Thanks for 200+ servers even in 2024 with hosting issues!
## ❓ About
Whick is a chat and fun bot on the social media app, Discord, which was my project in 2021-2022. Whick is interactive, with a lot of features such as it's own custom economy system! Made using javascript with node.js, mongoDB and Discord Developers. I made a new repository here since my old one had past commits with sensitive data of my bot's token, and other api authorizations that I used. 

## 👻 Is Stuff Missing?
Short answer: yes. No authorization token, node.js start up or any database related as they can all be obtained on your own for free!
